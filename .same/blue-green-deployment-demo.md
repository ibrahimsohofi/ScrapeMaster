# 🔄 Blue-Green Deployment Strategy Demo

## DataVault Pro Zero-Downtime Deployment

### 🎯 Overview

The blue-green deployment strategy ensures zero-downtime deployments by maintaining two identical production environments ("blue" and "green") and switching traffic between them during deployments.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup

#### **Environment Architecture**
```yaml
Blue Environment (Currently Live):
- Application Instances: 3 pods
- Database: Primary PostgreSQL cluster
- Load Balancer: Routes 100% traffic
- Status: ACTIVE - Serving customer traffic

Green Environment (Deployment Target):
- Application Instances: 3 pods (standby)
- Database: Shared with blue (read replicas)
- Load Balancer: Routes 0% traffic
- Status: STANDBY - Ready for deployment
```

#### **Shared Infrastructure Components**
```yaml
Shared Resources:
- PostgreSQL Primary: Shared between environments
- Redis Cluster: Shared session storage
- Object Storage: Shared file uploads/exports
- Monitoring Stack: Observes both environments
- SSL Certificates: Shared domain configuration
```

### 🚀 Deployment Process Simulation

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation**
```bash
# Step 1: Build and test new application version
echo "🔨 Building DataVault Pro v2.1.3..."
docker build -t datavault-pro:v2.1.3 .

# Step 2: Security and vulnerability scanning
echo "🔍 Running security scans..."
trivy image datavault-pro:v2.1.3

# Step 3: Run comprehensive test suite
echo "🧪 Running test suite..."
npm run test:all
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:performance

# Results:
# ✅ 2,847 unit tests passed
# ✅ 156 integration tests passed
# ✅ 23 E2E scenarios passed
# ✅ Performance benchmark: P95 < 450ms
# ✅ Security scan: No critical vulnerabilities
```

#### **Phase 2: Green Environment Deployment**
```bash
# Step 1: Deploy to green environment
echo "🟢 Deploying to GREEN environment..."
kubectl apply -f k8s/green-deployment.yaml

# Step 2: Wait for pods to be ready
echo "⏳ Waiting for green pods to be ready..."
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=datavault-pro,env=green --timeout=300s

# Step 3: Run health checks
echo "🏥 Running health checks on green environment..."
curl -f http://green.datavault.internal/api/health
curl -f http://green.datavault.internal/api/health/database
curl -f http://green.datavault.internal/api/health/redis

# Results:
# ✅ Application health: OK
# ✅ Database connectivity: OK
# ✅ Redis connectivity: OK
# ✅ External APIs: OK
# ✅ Background jobs: Processing
```

#### **Phase 3: Warm-up and Validation**
```bash
# Step 1: Warm up the green environment
echo "🔥 Warming up green environment..."
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -s http://green.datavault.internal/api/scrapers > /dev/null
  curl -s http://green.datavault.internal/api/dashboard/stats > /dev/null
done

# Step 2: Run smoke tests against green
echo "💨 Running smoke tests..."
npm run test:smoke -- --environment=green

# Step 3: Database migration validation
echo "🗄️ Validating database migrations..."
npm run db:migrate:validate -- --environment=green

# Results:
# ✅ Green environment warmed up
# ✅ Response times: P95 < 400ms
# ✅ All smoke tests passed
# ✅ Database schema: Compatible
```

#### **Phase 4: Traffic Switching (Canary → Full)**
```bash
# Step 1: Start with 10% traffic to green
echo "🚦 Routing 10% traffic to green environment..."
